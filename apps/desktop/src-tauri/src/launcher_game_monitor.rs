//! Same-binary detached game supervision. The CLI dispatch must run before any
//! GUI/config/account initialization. Sensitive launch data travels only through
//! the bounded anonymous stdin pipe; persistent state contains process identities
//! and captured root/log paths, never arguments, players or credentials.
//!
//! READY means Java spawned and its durable marker exists. COMMIT/ACK transfers
//! ownership to the helper; before that point every failure kills/reaps Java.
//! Reopening the launcher reads the marker and keeps that captured root busy.
